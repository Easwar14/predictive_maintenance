**Predictive Maintenance for CNC Machines**  

This project focuses on building an **efficient machine learning model** for the **predictive maintenance** of **CNC machines**. Unplanned breakdowns in CNC systemsâ€”caused by **electrical, environmental, or tooling failures**â€”can disrupt production and require a combination of **mechanical repairs and software troubleshooting**. By implementing **predictive maintenance**, catastrophic failures can be minimized, ensuring improved equipment reliability and reduced maintenance costs.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Project Overview**  
The project leverages **supervised learning models** to analyze historical machine data and predict potential failures before they occur. It utilizes **classification algorithms** such as **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to identify failure types based on input features.  

### **ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Methodology**  
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing sensor and operational data to handle missing values and outliers  
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying critical parameters affecting machine failures  
- **Model Training:** Implementing **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM** for classification  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- **Deployment Considerations:** Preparing the model for real-world applications in predictive maintenance systems  

### **ðŸš€ Key Outcomes**  
- **Early Fault Detection:** Predict whether a machine is at risk of failure  
- **Failure Classification:** Identify the type of failure (electrical, environmental, or tooling)  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules  
- **Cost Reduction:** Minimize maintenance costs and prevent major breakdowns  

This project showcases the **power of machine learning in industrial applications**, highlighting how predictive analytics can transform **maintenance strategies** in manufacturing.
