# predictive_maintenance
The project is about to generate an efficient machine learning model for the predictive maintenance 
of CNC machines. Any breakdown in the system, due to electrical, environmental, or tooling 
failures, may require a combination of mechanical and programming expertise to get it fixed, so 
catastrophic breakdowns can be easily avoided with predictive maintenance. This project uses a 
supervised learning model to learn and predict the labels for new data based on input features. 
Classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM are used to predict 
discrete outcomes. It highlights the benefits of this approach, including improved equipment 
reliability and reduced maintenance costs. The main outcome of the project is to determine if a 
machine could fail and if so, determine the nature of the failure. Prediction accuracy using the same 
SL model can be completely different for different training sets.
